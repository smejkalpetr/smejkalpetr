# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm a Software Engineer based in Prague, Czech Republic, currently working remotely for Persimmon Technologies Corporation. My main focus is on Control Software for vacuum robotics ðŸ¤–, a field that blends my interest in robotics and programming. I work primarily with C++ and Python, developing robust and efficient solutions for high-precision robotic systems.

In the past, Iâ€™ve contributed to a range of mobile and web-based projects â€” including a Cloud Storage App, a Dating App, and an Instrument Learning Platform â€” often taking full ownership of features and infrastructure. I enjoy working independently as well as part of a team, especially when it comes to solving challenging technical problems.

My current interests lie in robotics, embedded systems, C++ and performance-oriented software.
